		<h1>Communities</h1>
		<p>A community is a collection of experiences, expectations, ultimately communication strategies that grow up around a work independent of the work itself. For example, some Star Wars fans have more in common than just having seen the movie - they have developed a subculture or community.</p>
		<p>This is an attempt at sketching out communities with which I am at least peripherally associated, including links to learn more about each one. Forgive me if I stretch the definition of culture, subculture, or community a little.</p>

		<h2>Mormon</h2>
		<p>Truth, restored. A tagline for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - and true itself. Jesus Christ is alive today, and like His Father, has a glorified and perfected body of flesh and bone (no blood though). Him and His Father appeared to the young lad Joseph Smith in early 1820 and commanded him not to join any then existing church, due to a great falling away that had occurred many centuries previously. Jesus Christ still speaks with and visits man today, and His spirit is felt by any good people the world over. Still, the Priesthood authority was lost during this apostasy (falling away), which neccesitated a restoration of these ancient privilages. This was restored by angels sent from the presence of God, and now is on the earth and frequently used by worthy priesthood holders throughout the church today. The Book of Mormon (more conventionally, "Mormon's Book", as that was the name of the principle author) was translated by the gift and power of God, and the source records taken back into God's keeping. This is a book of true scripture, comparible to the Bible in its value to humanity. Men ordained and called to be prophets, seers and revelators walk the land, visiting and sustaining the Church. Miracles are real. I know, and I bear witness in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
		<p>TL;DR: The Church of Jesus Christ is the only true and living Church of Jesus Christ on the face of the earth today.</p>

		<h2>Wolf</h2>
		<p>It fit when I created him. Not a therianthrope, though I feel kinship (otherkin and wolf in common) with them :). Social anthropomorphic, well groomed black wolf (apparently black implies corruption of bloodline by domestic wolf, didn't know it at the time so and still not relevant). Works as a courier in the palace (maybe). Mostly represents me online, once in my more social form, now pretty generally since that's the one that people know me by now :).</p>

		<h2>Dragon?</h2>
		<p>Don't know. It fits, somehow? Possibly a power touchstone, for me. But, it's been around since I was less than 4 years old, so ... I know that my spirit has existed since long before earth life - basic Mormon doctrine that - and possibly another touchstone - that of "otherness".</p>

		<h2>Otherkin + Mormon = ???</h2>
		<p>Mostly just that I like the fit of it. The Church <em>is</em> true, so regardless of whatever else, if there is a conflict, I (typically :S) prefer the truth over fiction. Surprise, not perfect :P.</p>
