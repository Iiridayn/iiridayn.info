			<dd>I don't really have one - neither Rarity or Rainbow Dash would be my favorite. Possibly Twilight Sparkle, though Applejack would be very close. Fluttershy is cute, but needs more backbone; there's a time loop fanfic with a pretty neat Fluttershy. Pinkie Pie... I'd get pretty exhausted being around her! However, she likes to make people happy, which I both admire and appreciate. Applejack is stable, honest, stubborn to a fault, and hard working - I like all of that. And Twilight seems to share my passion for knowledge... as well as a number of my flaws as well. So it's a bit of a toss up between Twilight and Applejack.</dd>
