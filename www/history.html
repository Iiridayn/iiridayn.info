		<h1>A Brief History of Michael Clark</h1>
		<p>I've chosen to arrange this initially roughly by where I've lived, then by my education and jobs at the time. I'll be hitting only highlights - stories I often tell or which might be most generally relevant. For an autobiography, you'll have to get me to write one another time.</p>

		<h2>Birthplace, Atlanta, others</h2>
		<p>I was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts on <time datetime="1985-02-21">21 Feb 1985</time>. I lived in Massachusetts for the next six months. As a result the question "Where are you from?" to me has no relevance to birthplace. I moved to Atlanta where I lived off and on for the next three years. I also lived in Stockholm, Sweden for 3 months(?) and Mexico City, Mexico for 3 weeks. I remember a parade in Mexico City where the floats threw candy to the children along the streets, and I scrabbled with the other children for some. In Sweden I learned to say "mine" in Nursery at church. While living in Atlanta I played my first video game; we'd had a computer in the house since around the time I was 1.</p>

		<h2>New Hampshire</h2>
		<p>First grade was my only year ever of public school - I was withdrawn due to drugs and gun threats. In second grade my teacher told me my Father was a liar because he told me that negative numbers existed. In third grade my teacher instead told me that I was "probably just imagining" imaginary numbers.</p>
		<p>I enjoyed the "Jump for Life" jumprope program at Calvary Christian School, played defense in a local football (called "soccer" locally) team one year, and went to Basketball camp 2 years in a row. Near the end of this period I started to gain weight quicker than height. I also recall this as the last time period of my life in which I could easily wake in the morning.</p>

		<h2>Hong Kong</h2>
		<p>I acted up a little and didn't integrate as well into P5 as I might have, being a proud American. In P6 I was friends with Ben and Nathan - the former was the class troublemaker. I first played Magic: The Gathering and practiced fainting on command, and started collecting tennis balls.</p>
		<p>After Year 7 I switched back to the American school system for 7th grade at the International Christian School. I played the Tuba in the school band. Due to prejudice, I was best friends with the only Catholic, John O'Toole. I visited the principle sometimes 3-4 times per week, and I believe I was briefly suspended for a week. After that year no school in Hong Kong was happy to accept me as a student.</p>
		<p>Though frequently in debt due to parental fines, I saved up my money and purchased a N64 and later my first computer. We had 56k dialup at home due to university connections, and I spent a lot of time online playing MUDs and looking at artwork. At church I was friends with Thomas Rigby who introduced me to the Internet, MUDs, and would frequently play against me at StarFox on the N64.</p>

		<h2>Phelps Academy</h2>
		<p>I had the choice between a military boarding school or Phelps - a school for troubled students. My first year - 8th grade - was a foreign country to me and I was frequently disciplines. I suffered frequent physical battery and one time sexual assault from other students. By my second year - 10th grade - my moral standards had slipped a little and I was better tolerated. I had a perfect disciplinary record, and suffered one count of sexual battery, in addition to severe and prolonged psychological warfare from the same student.</p>
		<p>My favorite teacher was Mr. Knopp, who encouraged my love of mathematical calculation. I recieved a course grade of over 100% in Geometry, despite feeling that I didn't really understand the principles adequately. Mr. Brokowski taught English and also influenced me, by grading me for effort instead of result. The second year I joined a reading challenge - the top readers in the school would have a year-end party. After 3 months the librarian banned me from reading further Speculative Fiction, so I started checking them out myself while she wasn't looking (I'm 90% sure she knew what I was doing) and stopped submitting book reports - I was still the top reader of the year.</p>
		<p>After school activities were mandatory, so I took two years of Lacross, one of weight lifting (which may also have contributed to my second year), two of Basketball, and one of Power Yoga. Every day after Power Yoga I would literally stagger back to the dorm, as every major muscle hurt. My coordination, balance, and flexibility improved noticably as a result.</p>

		<h2>Independant Study</h2>
		<p>After my second year at Phelps my parents decided they would try BYU Independant study courses with me. I had taken 9th grade English the previous year to skip 9th grade, and the plan was to get me into BYU by age 16. This moderately succeeded, with support and pressure from my parents. In the end I applied to BYU under "early admit" and was accepted due to decent grades and ACT score.</p>

		<h2>BYU</h2>
		<p>Broadband internet. Oh, and classes as well. My friends changed every semester as classes and living assignments changed, but for the first time, I regularly had friends - plural! Age didn't matter much anymore, and I kept mostly quiet about mine so as to avoid standing out. Teachers respected their students' interest and capability to learn and contribute. University was a Renaissance for me. I loved it.</p>
		<p>I found myself taking lots of computer classes, since I had always loved computers. I declared Computer Science my major so that I could continue taking more courses. Suddenly, one day they told me that I'd graduated and wasn't allowed to take any more.</p>
		<p>During this time period I glutted myself on American media so that I would have a common cultural reference with my peers. I couldn't afford any of it, but I had purchased pirated software in Hong Kong and learned where to find pirated movies and music online. Most of the movies and anime which I've seen I watched at this stage of my life - in particular movies rated "R", which I no longer watch. I took a liking to Anime, which I'd never watched before. I also played my first First Person Shooter, Unreal Tournament.</p>

		<h2>HKUST</h2>
		<p>Lacking a clear direction in my life when I graduated BYU at age 19, and still unready to be a missionary, my father gave me the choice to return to school on his dime or to get a job. I returned to school - applied and was accepted to the Information Systems Masters program at HKUST, where my father teaches. Despite my concerns that I may have gotten in only due to family connections, I performed quite well in the coursework - no thanks to him. To ensure fair treatment, my father refused to discuss business topics with me during the program. I found it a little frustrating at the time, but understand why it had to be. I also did some RA work as a programmer for the online game <a href="http://www.skylords.com">SkyLords</a>, which I still host.</p>
		<p>I lived at home with my father, the rest of the family in Utah during those years, him commuting to Utah twice a year. At one point, home alone for several weeks, I managed to total the family car and might have lost my life due to poor judgement and excessive sleepiness caused by same. I've come near to dying on a few occasions, but this was rather disconcerting.</p>

		<h2>Mission - Atlanta, GA</h2>
		<p>I was called to Atlanta, Georgia, speaking Spanish - I like to say that it was a foreign country with a foreign language, as the US was still odd to me at that time. I had ups and downs, companions I got along with and others I didn't; pretty normal for a mission experience. My last companion was worse in some ways than my second year at Phelps, or I was simply more sensitive because of that period.</p>

		<h2>Heritage Web Solutions / HIT Webdesign</h2>
		<p>I returned home to Utah, a couple months before the family moved everybody back to Hong Kong full time. I was left without money, job, or residence, but that all worked itself out well enough. I worked at HIT Webdesign for several years, till they went out of business. I was promoted to Lead Programmer on a major project for a time, and also served for a time as Elder's Quorum President in the Ward. I was able to step down from my work position, and was eventually released from my church calling shortly before a large YSA Stake reorginization. During the last three months at HIT I worked without pay, though the quality of my output decreased as my confidence did. I ended up taking a several month vacation afterwards to try to recover from the experience. While working at HIT I started having some difficulty coming in on time, due to difficulties sleeping at a reasonable hour. I also had braces put on during this period.</p>

		<h2>ZAGG</h2>
		<p>I needed money, so I turned to recruiters, who found me a job with ZAGG. They were a fun company to work for and have a lot of great culture - sadly, I was on a contract to hire, and they offered me significantly less than I was making or had made at HIT, so I chose not to exercise the hire option. I moved up to Salt Lake City for a year in order to be closer to my workplace.</p>

		<h2>InsideSales.com and Intuiplan</h2>
		<p>InsideSales made me an offer I couldn't refuse - more than I was making at ZAGG already, potential to grow, another great CEO, and an excellent cafeteria. I stayed for as long as I could, but eventually my sleep difficulties were too much for the company, and I was encouraged to seek another job. A little startup named Intuiplan made me an offer I couldn't refuse - more than I was making at InsideSales and a moderately flexible work schedule. I worked well with most of the key employees, but personality conflicts with the other programmer eventually lead to the agreement that termination was our best option.</p>

		<h2>Current</h2>
		<p>I've been "between jobs" since <time datetime="2013-07-31">July 2013</time>, slowly depleting my savings once again. I've been seeing a sleep psychologist about my schedule difficulties, and hope to have that resolved soon.</p>
