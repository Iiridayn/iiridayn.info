		</ul>

		<h2>Western Animation</h2>
		<p>Note that I only own MLP:FIM season 1, which I will be gifting soon.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Avatar - most of first season</li>
			<li>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic - first season, just waiting for a DVD/Blueray for the second season to come out :)</li>
			<li>Teen Titans - some, a couple seasons?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Shows with live actors</h2>
		<p>It's worth noting that I've had no television service for most of my life (and currently have none that I'm aware of), so my collection here is smaller than it might seem - I've made up for it with foreign cartoons.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Andromeda - roughly third season</li>
			<li>White Collar - roughly second season</li>
			<li>Babylon 5 - should have stopped after season 4 ended. Stopped after season 5 episode 7's sex scene, will not return to the series.</li>
		</ul>
