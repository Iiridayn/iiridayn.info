		<h1>TV Series</h1>
		<p>This page will list series that I own and that I've seen.</p>

		<h2>Western Animation</h2>
		<p>Note that I only own MLP:FIM season 1, which I will be gifting soon.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="dvd">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic - first season, just waiting for a DVD/Blueray for the second season to come out :)</li>
			<li class="broadcast">Avatar - most of first season</li>
			<li class="broadcast">Teen Titans - some, a couple seasons?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Live Actors</h2>
		<p>It's worth noting that I've had no television service for most of my life (and currently have none that I'm aware of), so my collection here is smaller than it might seem - I've made up for it with foreign cartoons.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Andromeda - roughly third season</li>
			<li class="dvd">White Collar - roughly second season</li>
			<li class="dvd">Babylon 5 - should have stopped after season 4 ended. Stopped after season 5 episode 7's sex scene, will not return to the series.</li>
			<li class="dvd">Charmed (first 3 seasons? Prue thing was recent to me)</li>
			<li class="stream"><a href="http://drhorrible.com/">Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a></li>
