		<h1>Things that I would like to own</h1>
		<p>So, since this is going to be a literal <em>wish</em>list, some things are idle, some things are projects, and some things I merely have yet to buy (but will). For most who wish to get me something from this list I would recommend things that I was going to buy anyway - just make sure that I don't actually buy it before you gift it!</p>

		<h2>General Gift Ideas</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>New (and unusual) flavors</li>
			<li>Chocolate preferred if buying sweets</li>
			<li>Personally recommended Spec Fic books I don't own</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Things that would like to purchase</h2>
