		<h1>Things that I would like to own</h1>
		<p>So, since this is going to be a literal <em>wish</em>list, some things are idle, some things are projects, and some things I merely have yet to buy (but will). For most who wish to get me something from this list I would recommend things that I was going to buy anyway - just make sure that I don't actually buy it before you gift it!</p>
		<p>Mark an item as purchased by clicking on it - if "Show Purchased Items" is on it will have a line through it when you mouse away. In case of a misclick, with "Show Purchased Items" on you can click it a second time to mark it unpurchased.<noscript> Sorry - these features require JavaScript to function!</noscript></p>
