		<h1>Things that I would like to own</h1>
		<p>So, since this is going to be a literal <em>wish</em>list, some things are idle, some things are projects, and some things I merely have yet to buy (but will). For most who wish to get me something from this list I would recommend things that I was going to buy anyway - just make sure that I don't actually buy it before you gift it!</p>

		<h2>General Gift Ideas</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>New (and unusual) flavors</li>
			<li>Chocolate preferred if buying sweets</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Online Wishlists</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3QX8ES2WGDVQH">Things that I find interesting and might buy</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/13DERBIBMDSDU">Things that I will actually buy, but have not yet</a> - note that as of Dec 2013 everything within my reasonable price-range has been cleaned out from this list (though not removed, so avoid this one for now).</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>Supplies, training, equipment, or aid appreciated.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Carrying pouches</li>
			<li><s>Winter cloak</s></li>
			<li>Quadsuit hand stilts - articulated finger/toes</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Already experienced, wish to own</h2>
		<p>Most of the <a href="anime.html">anime</a> which I've seen I would like to own if I don't already.</p>
